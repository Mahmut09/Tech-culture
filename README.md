This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
address Erc contract - 0x46D847815789536aFD44314672891661e8EdDB18
BscScan Erc contract - https://testnet.bscscan.com/address/0x46D847815789536aFD44314672891661e8EdDB18
address Staking contract - 0x4fF41bB082CB80E0d02af18bBa2bD0E420dbd535
BscScan Erc contract - https://testnet.bscscan.com/address/0x4fF41bB082CB80E0d02af18bBa2bD0E420dbd535
```
